# Docker Images

### Introduction

This project contains docker images that I have created to boost my productivity (I mean, maybe :p).
The fact is, for me, having modular environments is perfect. Because If I want to reset all my computers,
or share a project with someone, I want to do it quickly.

A good example is Android Studio, each time, 
when I have to use Android 23, or +, when I need a special configuration for projectA and another for projectB, 
the configuration can take a while.  

So, I decided to move all of this configuration inside docker, and share it with you.
